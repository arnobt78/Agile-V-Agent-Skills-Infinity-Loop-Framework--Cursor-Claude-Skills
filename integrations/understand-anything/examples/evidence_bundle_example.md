## Graph Traceability Matrix

| Requirement | Graph Node | File/Symbol | Change Type | Test Evidence | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| REQ-0001: Login continues to work | node-042 | `src/auth/auth.controller.ts::login` | Modified | `auth.e2e-spec.ts::should login with valid credentials` | Verified |
| REQ-002: 5 attempts allowed | node-044 | `src/auth/guards/rate-limit.guard.ts` | Added | `auth.e2e-spec.ts::boundary test` | Verified |
| REQ-003: 6th attempt returns 429 | node-044 | `src/auth/guards/rate-limit.guard.ts` | Added | `auth.e2e-spec.ts::should return 429` | Verified |
| REQ-004: Retry-After header present | node-044 | `src/auth/guards/rate-limit.guard.ts` | Added | `auth.e2e-spec.ts::headers test` | Verified |
| REQ-005: Counter resets after 60s | node-044 | `src/auth/guards/rate-limit.guard.ts` | Added | `auth.e2e-spec.ts::rate limit resets` | Verified |
| REQ-006: Rate limit events logged | node-042 | `src/auth/auth.controller.ts::login` | Modified | `auth.controller.spec.ts::log test` | Verified |

### Orphan Requirements

None.

### Orphan Changes

| File/Symbol | Issue |
|---|---|
| `src/auth/auth.module.ts::AuthModule` | Changed (throttler registration) but not linked to a requirement. Justified: module wiring required by REQ-002. |

### Traceability Decision

- **Pass**
- All requirements have linked components and test evidence.
- The one orphan change is justified as implementation scaffolding for REQ-002.

## Diff Impact Report (excerpt)

### Summary

Added `@nestjs/throttler` rate limiting to the login endpoint. A new `RateLimitGuard` was
created and registered in `AuthModule`. The controller was updated to apply the guard.

### Predicted vs Actual Impact

| Component | Predicted | Changed | Explanation |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `src/auth/auth.controller.ts` | Yes | Yes | Expected — guard applied here. |
| `src/auth/auth.module.ts` | Yes | Yes | Expected — throttler registered. |
| `src/auth/guards/rate-limit.guard.ts` | Yes (new) | Yes | Expected — new guard. |
| `src/auth/auth.service.ts` | Low confidence | No | Not required; guard runs before service. |
| `src/app.module.ts` | Medium | No | `ThrottlerModule` registered in `AuthModule`, not globally. |

### Unexpected Changes

None.

### Regression Evidence

| Risk | Test Evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Core login broken | `auth.e2e-spec.ts::should login with valid credentials` | Pass |
| Error handling broken | `auth.e2e-spec.ts::should reject invalid credentials` | Pass |
| Rate limit not enforced | `auth.e2e-spec.ts::should return 429` | Pass |
| Multi-instance Redis | Not tested in CI | Manual — see release notes |

### Decision

- **Accept**
- All acceptance criteria verified. One known gap (multi-instance) documented in release notes.
